  * 0.9.0 When adding HTTP headers, we now make sure the names are not blank
            as that causes connection errors.
          The Autopilot Boxes now recognise an HTTP 202 (Accepted) as a good status.
            The latest signalk-autopilot plugin now returns 202s.
          Added back the change log.

          New Boxes:
            Autopilot Reefing Control
            Log, Total and Trip. Thanks to Mike K for the suggestion.

          Box updates:
            SunlightBox: now aligned at top.
  * 0.8.0 We now handle data timeouts on a per-path basis. This allows one
            value in a multi-value Box to timeout, e.g. WPT Bearing in the CompassRoseBox.
          Help can now be written in Markdown. This allow easier formatting and linking.
          Added Remote Control functionality.
          When editing pages, hitting the Android Back button now prompts to discard changes.
          Authentication is now handled at the application level rather than per-box.
          You can now export backup configs and log files.
          Added commandline arguments for:
            --enable-poweroff - Enables a Poweroff button on the setting page.
            --keyboard - enables an embedded onscreen keyboard
          In Demo mode we don't add any HTTP headers, as this can stop the connection.
          Brightness controls are disabled on Linux as there's no implementation.

          New Boxes:
            Remote Control
            Compass Rose
            Compass Gauge
            Starlink
            Timers
            Stopwatch
            Sailor Hat

          Box updates:
            Degree values are now marked with a degrees symbol rather than 'deg'.
            Temperature unit now show degrees symbol.

            NextPointBearingBox: removed smoothing.

              the value is subject to smoothing.
            Sunlight/Moon Boxes now handle null values per-path.
            Electrical Boxes now flag there data as Infrequent.
  * 0.7.0 Application time is now taken from the SignalK server. This ensures
            timestamps are handled correctly even on devices not correctly
            time synchronised.
          Added Notifications Log display.
          If we fails to read the config we back it up before reverting to
            the default.
          Added --enable-set-time command line option to allow setting
            the OS time from 'navigation.datetime'.
          Added --config-file command line option to allow multiple instances
            to be run with different configs.
          Added --no-full-screen command line option to disable Full Screen
            functionality on flutter-pi builds.
          In "Read Only" mode the Error Log can now be displayed.
          The Box selection menu is now more compact.
          To allow for more complex SignalK setups, the SignalK Server
            is now specified as a URL rather than host and port. The config is
            automatically updated to the new format and a backup kept in
            boatinstrument.json.v0.
          HTTP headers can now be added in the setting to allow auth/proxy
              headers to be added.
              Thanks to James P for the idea and testing.
          Added "Full Screen" button.
            Thanks to Eric S for the idea.
          The Save/Discard buttons on the Page Edit screen are now more
            prominent and you have to confirm when discarding changes.
            Thanks to Eric S for the feedback.
          SignalK data can now be designated "Real Time", "Infrequent" or "Static"
            and there are now separate "Real Time" and "Infrequent" timeout values.
          We now handle notifications that don't include "method"s or "message"s.

            Date/Time: added option to show a UTC conversion button.
            Sun/Moonlight boxes now have a UTC conversion button.
            WindRose: added option to allow the true wind needle to be on top of the speed boxes and
              the pointer scale down on smaller roses.
            Graphs: shorten units from "Minutes" to "Mins" to cope with small displays better.
            Anchor: we now check for anchor raising values so that other instruments reflect the anchor state.
              The sizes are now rendered last so that they are always readable.
            Replaced "Speed" with "STW".
            WPT Distance: remove smoothing.

            Semi Gauge Boxes now scale to their containing Box.
            Gauge pointers now scale down on small gauges and show red when the 
              value is out of range.
  * 0.6.0 Restructured the Box selection menu.
          For the flutter-pi install, you can now exit the instrument
            from the Setting page and the config is then copied to
            "/boot/boatinstrument.json.running" before the instrument restarts.
            "/boot/boatinstrument.config" is moved to "/etc/boatinstrument/config".
          The default configs have been updated to auto discover the signalk
            server, rather then going into demo mode.
          The row of buttons in the header bar of the Settings page now collapse
            into a menu on narrower screens.
          Updates to in-app help.
          Data handling in graphs has been simplified.

              reconnect if only static data is displayed.
            When editing Boxes, we now cope with devices that have restricted

  * 0.4.0 Added option for enabling Experimental Boxes.
  
          We now handle notifications in a more sane way so we don't continually
          show repeat notifications. We also mute individual notifications
          rather than all or none. Muted notifications are automatically un-muted
          after a configurable number of minutes.

          On devices that have restricted areas of the screen, e.g. phones with
          notches, we now display Boxes outside these areas.

            Issue when filtering paths in Custom Boxes
            Rudder Angle Box could draw out of bounds
            When scaling text, we now make sure the font size is at least readable.

          Updated the Help Box and Page.

          Support for arm32 builds.
  * 0.2.0 Added a "Demo Mode".
          Added Depth below Keel and Transducer Boxes.
