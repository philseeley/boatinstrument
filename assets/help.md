The display shows a number of Pages and swiping left/right moves between them.

Swiping down and selecting ![Image](assets/icons/web.png) shows the list of Pages. Press the ![Image](assets/icons/edit.png) button to edit a Page. Each Page is made up of multiple Page Rows (Red), containing multiple Columns (Orange), containing multiple Rows (Yellow), containing multiple Boxes (Blue). Use the coloured arrows to add Page elements.

**Hint**: sometimes you may need to temporarily resize a Box to show all the buttons.

The contents of each Box is selected through the ![Image](assets/icons/list.png) button. If the Box has settings these are set through the ![Image](assets/icons/settings.png) buttons in the top right of the Box. The Blue button sets the Per-Box settings and the White/Black button sets the Box Type settings that are shared between all instances of the Box.

The sizes of the Page elements can be adjusted by dragging the coloured Box borders. If the last Box in a Row or Column is deleted, the Row or Column is also deleted.

Whilst in "Edit Mode" dummy values are shown, usually the value "12.3". This allows you to gauge what the Boxes will look like when running.

Swiping up or pressing the back button hides the top bar.

For "Auto Discovery" of your SignalK server, mDNS must be turned on in your server's settings. If discovery does not work, enter your server's hostname/IP and port number.

The "Subscription Min Period" is the minimum time between data updates. Increasing this value will reduce the load on your SignalK server.

If no data is received within the "Connection Timeout" the connection is reopened.

If a Box receives no data within the "Data Timeout" the box is cleared and a "-" is generally displayed.

In "Demo Mode" the app connects to "https://demo.signalk.org"
