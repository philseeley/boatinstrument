An instances of the app can be controlled remotely, either individually or as part of a group. To enable remote control, the **Allow Remote Control** setting in the main **Settings** page must be enabled and the app **ID** set to a unique value. If you want to control the app as part of a group, the **Group ID** must also be set.

Both the **Controlled** and **Controlling** apps must have a read/write **Auth Token** set in the main **Settings** page, see [Authentication](doc:authentication.md) for more details.

On the **Controlling** apps, one or more **Remote Control** boxes can then be set-up as required.
