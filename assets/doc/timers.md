# Timers

Timers are defined in the **Timers Setup** Box and must be activated at least once before they can be selected for display in the **Timer Display** Box.

There are two types of timer, **Absolute** and **Delta**. **Absolute** Timers expire at a defined time and **Delta** Timers are relative to when they are started.

Only **Delta** Timers can be restarted or stopped from the **Timer Display** Box.

All Timers must have an **ID**, but you can define multiple Timers with the same **ID**, e.g. you could define three **Delta** Timers for 20, 10 and 5 minutes intervals all with the **ID** "start". Only one of these can be active at a time.
